Description:
    alt_model generator is an alternative model generator using Machinist
    and Rspec.

    No fixture option.

Example:
    ./script/generate alt_model Account

        Model                  : app/models/account.rb
        Spec                   : spec/models/account_spec.rb
        Migration              : db/migrate/XXX_add_accounts.rb
        Machinist blueprint in : spec/blueprints.rb
